      Hello , my name is Alihan , I'm a student at Yeditepe University Faculty of Medicine ( 4 / 6 ) in Istanbul , Turkey. Before diving into medicine , I spent a year studying chemical engineering at Ko√ß University , which sparked my interest in computational side of medical research.

    As an undergraduate intern at Yeditepe University Hospital's Stem Cell Laboratory , I've been learning the diagnostic use of flow cytometry. I also work on a project that aims to classify different cell populations using machine learning.
