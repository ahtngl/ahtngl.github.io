## Projects

### Tübitak 2209 A

Funded by Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey

**Title:** Classification of Hematogons and Neoplastic B Lymphoblasts through Computational Analysis of Immunophenotypic Flow Cytometry Data

**Summary:** Hematogons are B lymphocyte precursors that share similarities with neoplastic B lymphoblasts in terms of immunophenotypic patterns. This resemblance leads to difficulties in distinguishing neoplastic B lymphoblasts seen in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) from hematogons, adversely affecting the diagnosis and treatment processes of B-ALL. This project aims to analyse immunophenotypic patterns of thses cells with a machine learning algorithm to enable their direct differentiation, thereby strives to contribute the diagnosis and treatment processes of B-ALL.
