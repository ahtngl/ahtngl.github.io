     My name is Alihan Hatunoglu , I'm currently in my 4th year at Yeditepe University Faculty of Medicine in Istanbul , Turkey. Before diving into medicine , I spent some time studying engineering at Ko√ß University , which gave me a perspective on problem solving and a strong interest in the computational side of medical research.

    Outside of academics, I enjoy bouldering, running, and spending time in nature. I also love watching films on MUBI, reading ancient Greek philosophy, and experimenting with photography. These interests keep me balanced and inspired.
