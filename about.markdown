      I'm a 4th grade student at Yeditepe University Faculty of Medicine ( 4 / 6 ) in Istanbul / Turkey. Before diving into medicine , I spent a year studying chemical engineering at Ko√ß University , which gave me a strong interest in the computational side of medical research.

    Currently , I'm an undergraduate intern at Yeditepe University Hospital Stem Cell Laboratory where I've been learning how to analyse flow cytometry data to diagnose hematopoietic neoplasms. I also work on a project myself that focuses on classifying different cell populations using machine learning.

In the future , I aspire to approach complex diseases with computational & quantitative methods to develop better treatment options that are more effective and sustainable.
