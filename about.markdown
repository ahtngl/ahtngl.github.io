     My name is Alihan , I'm a 4th grade medical student at Yeditepe University - Istanbul / Turkey. Before diving into medicine , I spent one year studying chemical engineering at Ko√ß University , which gave me a perspective on problem solving and a strong interest in the computational side of medical research.
